# HOW TO
###

    Pregit is a program which is used to run scripts before invoking the user's
git executable. These scripts are written by the user, placed in a path
relative to the repository's root directory, and chosen based on the git
subcommand given.

    Most of pregit's configuration is contained in a small set of environment
variables which must be set at runtime. If any one of these variables is unset
(except for PREGIT_SILENT), pregit will issue a warning to STDERR. See the
section on ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND CONFIG for more information.

    Scripts are chosen based on the git subcommand that is passed to the pregit
script. For example, if `git status` is invoked, pregit will look for a script
which is correlated to the `status` subcommand by a particular naming scheme.
This naming scheme is documented herein.

    The scripts are just plain bash scripts, so the user may put any bash
source in them. It may be important to note that pregit runs the scripts using
the source command.

WARNING. IF THIS PROGRAM IS INSTALLED ON YOUR SYSTEM, NEVER RUN GIT AS THE ROOT
USER. DOING SO MAY LEAD TO SYSTEM COMPROMISE AND UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS.

# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND CONFIG
###

PREGIT_PREFIX
	This variable contains a string which must precede each of the scripts.
    For example, if PREGIT_PREFIX=".pregit-" then pregit will run a script with
    the filename ".pregit-status" when `git status` is invoked by the user.
    If the user has chosen to organize their scripts into a subdirectory,
    pregit will look for a script named "${PREGIT_PREFIX}/status"

PREGIT_ALLOW_DIR
	If this is set to "1", pregit will search subdirectories for scripts.

PREGIT_ALLOW_SCRIPTS
	If this is not set to "1", a warning will be issued and pregit will not
    look for or execute scripts.

PREGIT_GIT_LOCATION
	This variable contains the pathname of the git executable. If this
    variable is unset, pregit will issue a warning and attempt to run the
    executable at the path returned by `which git`.

PREGIT_SILENT
	If this variable is set (i.e. not ""), pregit will not issue warnings
    of any kind.
