<h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>This is a repository that contains some of my dot-files and other things
  that I find useful enough to employ pretty much every day. Most of it would
  probably be useless to anyone other than myself, but it's certainly
  convenient for me to put it here, so here it is.</p>
